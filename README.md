# School_District_Analysis
first development environment project


Here is the list of deliverables for the analysis of the school district: 

A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
School performance based on the budget per student
School performance based on the school size 
School performance based on the type of school
Before we can begin these tasks, we need to import the datasets into Jupyter Notebook using Python.


Determine data types:

Based on the output, we determined that all of the columns we need to use for calculations are integers. Therefore, we won't need to change the data types for these columns. However, there may be instances in which it's necessary to change the data type. Some CSV and text files, for example, may contain numbers as strings (or objects) rather than integers. These numbers would need to be converted to integers or floats.


The school district summary will be a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics:

Total number of students
Total number of schools
Total budget
Average math score
Average reading score
Percentage of students who passed math
Percentage of students who passed reading
Overall passing percentage
